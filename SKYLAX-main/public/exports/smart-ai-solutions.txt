Prompt for Copilot (integration without backgrounds)

- Copy the SmartAISolutionsLite component into your project (a React file).
- Place the images at /public/assets/images/ (ai-img1.png, ai-img2.png, ai-img3.png, ai-img4.png) or update the image paths accordingly.
- Do not add any gradient or background styles. Keep only text and images as in this component.
- Keep heading sizes approximately: H1 ~48px, card title ~32px, message ~18px, detail title ~18px, detail text ~15px.
- If using Next.js, you may replace <img> with next/image, but keep layout simple and avoid any background or overlay props.
- Center the main H1 and use the 3-column layout as shown; for mobile you may stack columns vertically.
